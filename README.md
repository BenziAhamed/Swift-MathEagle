# Swift-MathEagle
Math Eagle is named after the golden eagle, since this is the fastest bird in the world (in horizontal flight).

This project is meant to make math easy in swift. The syntax is designed to be as simple as possible. Contributors are always welcome, the more the merrier!

#Installation
XCode currently doesn't support pure swift frameworks, so the project can now be added as a submodule. You can then drag the MathEagle folder to your XCode file list.
