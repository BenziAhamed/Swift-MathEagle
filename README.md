# Swift-MathEagle
Math Eagle is named after the golden eagle, since this is the fastest bird in the world (in horizontal flight).

This project is meant to make math easy in swift. The syntax is designed to be as simple as possible. Contributors are always welcome, the more the merrier!

#Installation
XCode currently doesn't support pure swift frameworks. You can add it as a submodule:
  1. Add this repo as a submodule.
  2. Drag the MathEagle folder to your XCode file list. Make sure to add it to the target.
  3. It's ready to use!

#Supported Xcode Versions
Math Eagle is fully compatible with:
- Xcode 6.2 (current official version)

Xcode 6.3 beta gives a 'segmentation fault: 11' error, this is normally an Apple bug.

#Currently Supported
* Basic extensions, operators like power (** operator) and functions like sign and factorial
* Prime functions
* Complex numbers
* Single variable function root solving
* Single variable function optimization
* Matrix and Vector math

Take a look at the Wiki for documentation.
